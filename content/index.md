Hi, I'm Qinghui. I’m a Software Engineer based in Sydney, Australia, currently at ==Microsoft==, where I focus on building ==LLM infrastructure== and ==intelligent agents==. My professional passion lies at the intersection of ==large-scale distributed systems== and ==runtime performance optimization==.

Before my current role, I was at ==Tencent Cloud==, working as a core engineer for Serverless system node agents. My work centered on extreme performance tuning—achieving the goal of managing over ==2,000 containers on a single bare-metal node== with ==near-zero overhead== and ==ultra-low latency==.

Earlier in my career, I spent 3 years at ==Alibaba Cloud==, where I was responsible for building internal ==multi-tenant Serverless infrastructure== and maintaining the group’s ==core container engines==. My work supported a wide range of internal business units and was instrumental in ensuring the stability and performance of the infrastructure during ==Double 11 (Global Shopping Festival)==, handling some of the world's most intense traffic spikes.

With deep expertise in ==Kubernetes==, ==containerd==, and ==LLM inference runtime==, I’ve spent much of my career conducting my work in the ==open-source community==. I’m a firm believer in the power of open source, sharing knowledge, and constantly experimenting with the "bleeding edge" of technology.

I started this blog to document the practical insights and technical lessons I’ve learned from the trenches of cloud-native engineering and AI infrastructure. I’m always excited to connect and dive deep into system architecture—feel free to reach out!
